    "## Running Quantum Examples Using IBM Data Science Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how you can run a Quantum notebook using [IBM Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com) (IBM DSX) enviromnent. If you want to run other Quantum notebooks in this environment, simply copy the first *code cell* and paste it at the beginning of your *other* notebook and then execute that notebook in the DSX environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "### About IBM Data Science Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM Data Science Experience is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to activate their insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just starting with QISKit and looking for a webhosted Jupyter notebook environment, IBM DSX is an excellent option. It is fairly easy to get your quantum notebook running in the Jupyter notebook environment provided by IBM DSX. Moreover, it provides a platform where you can create your Quantum notebooks, invite fellow researchers to collaborate or simply share your work within the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you need to do\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how to tweak your notebook so that it is ready to be run using IBM DSX. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the first code cell, make sure to update the value of **`os.environ[\"IBMQE_API\"]`** See the heading below that instructs how to get this information. \n",
    "* To run any other Quantum experience notebooks in IBM  DSX, copy the first *code cell* of this notebook and paste it as the first *code cell* of your '*other*' notebook then execute it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting your API token\n",
    "\n",
    "The API access token allows you to connect to the IBM Quantum Experience API.  Here is how you can obtain this personal API access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you do not have an account for [IBM Q experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net) yet, sign up for one by following the instructions . \n",
    "2. Login to [IBM Q Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net).\n",
    "3. Click on your username that is displayed near the top right corner, and select `My Account > Advanced`\n",
    "4. Copy the API token displayed there. \n",
    "5. Update the value of `os.environ[\"IBMQE_API\"]` in the first code cell with this API token. Put another way, replace the default value `\"PUT_YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\"` with your actual API token. \n",
    "6. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you are planning to share your notebook with collaborators, make sure to remove the API token before sharing. Alternatively, you can add your own code to read the value from a file or set it as an environment variable. \n",
