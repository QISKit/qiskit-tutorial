# Say Hello to QISKIT!

This is the folder for 'hello world' type examples - simple, relatable, whimsical examples to help someone get their foot in the door of quantum programming with QISKit - quote from James Wootton of the University of Basel.

Currently the only example we have is [Quantum Emoticon](quantum_emoticon.ipynb)

If you would like your own examples included in our featured 'hello world' examples, please send us a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with a link to your repository.
