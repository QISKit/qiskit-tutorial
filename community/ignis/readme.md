# Quantum characterization, validation, verification and mitigation with Qiskit Ignis

In this folder we have a collection of great tutorials from our fantastic Qiskitters describing various concepts in quantum characterization, validation, verification and mitigation.

* [Incoherent Noise](coherence-overview.ipynb): Overview of common sources of incoherent noise on quantum devices (e.g. T1 and T2) and what experiments used used to measure these noise parameters.

* [Measurement Error and Mitigation](measurement_error_mitigation.ipynb): Introduction to measurement, assignment error and how to mitigate.

* [State and Process Tomography Overview](tomography-overview.ipynb): Introduction to state and process tomography and different representations of a quantum process.

## Contributing

Quantum characterization is such an interesting topic and we have by no means covered everything! We welcome additional notebooks in the relevant folder.
