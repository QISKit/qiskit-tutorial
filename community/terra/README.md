# Quantum Information Science with Qiskit Terra

In this folder we have a collection of great tutorials from our fantastic Qiskitters describing various quantum physics and computing concepts using Qiskit Terra.

If you are new to quantum computing, we suggest starting with the following tutorials, which introduce the qubit and the concepts of superposition and entanglement. Please note that these assume you know some linear algebra. 
1. [Single Qubits: Superposition](superposition.ipynb)
2. [Single Qubits: Amplitude and Phase](amplitude_and_phase.ipynb)
3. [Multiple Qubits: Creating Entanglement](entanglement_introduction.ipynb)
4. [Multiple Qubits: Testing Entanglement](entanglement_testing.ipynb)
5. [Multiple Qubits: Teleportation and Superdense Coding](teleportation_superdensecoding.ipynb)

Once you feel that you understand the basics, you can explore the rest of the tutorials in this folder, or move on and learn about [quantum algorithms with Qiskit Terra](../algorithms/) and [quantum applications with Qiskit Aqua](../aqua).
