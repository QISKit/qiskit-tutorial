# Teach Me Quantum Award 2018: Top Submissions

The 'Teach Me Quantum Award' sought out the best lecture materials using Qiskit. For information about the winning submissions, see [here](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/01/ibmq-teach-quantum-winners/).

In this folder you'll find the winning submissions (numbered below) as well as the other high-quality submissions (bullet points below). Note that these materials were prepared using previous versions of Qiskit. We are working to update them, and would appreciate any feedback on which ones to priortize. So don't be shy, and submit [an issue](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/issues) to share your comments.
