# Quantum Cryptography
## QRandom --> Generates random numbers.
The random number is directly generated from Hadamard gate. It is similar to rolling an n-faced dice, where n is the number of Qbits. It is the worst way to generate random numbers using a quantum computer but the sequence developed is truly random.
