    "The easiest way to get started is to use [the Binder image](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/master?filepath=index.ipynb), which lets you use the notebooks via the web. This means that you don't need to download or install anything, but is also means that you should not insert any private information into the notebooks (such as your API key). We recommend that after you are done using mybinder that you regenerate your token. \n",

    "The tutorials can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/archive/master.zip) and to set them up follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/INSTALL.md).\n",
