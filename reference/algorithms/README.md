# Examples of Quantum Algorithms in QISKit

Here are some well-known quantum algorithms implemented with QISKit and executed on
simulators and real-device backends. New contributions of algorithmic tutorials
are welcomed.

- [Deutschâ€“Jozsa algorithm](deustch_josza.ipynb) - an exact quantum algorithm that outperforms deterministic classical algorithms
- [Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm](bernstein_vazirani.ipynb) - a quantum algorithm that outperforms probabilistic algorithms
- [Phase estimation](iterative_phase_estimation_algorithm.ipynb) - a quantum algorithm to determine eigenvalues of unknown unitary operator
- Simon's algorithm for period finding (Coming Soon)
- [Grover's algorithm](grover_algorithm.py) for searching a needle in haystack
- Shor's algorithm for integer factorization (Coming Soon)
- Quantum Walk (Coming Soon)
