# Understanding your quantum computer
This set of notebooks describe a few of the techniques used to characterise, verify and validate quantum systems.
  * [Relaxation and decoherence](relaxation_and_decoherence.ipynb) - how to measure coherence times on the real quantum hardware.
  * [Quantum state tomography](state_tomography.ipynb) - how to identify a quantum state using state tomography, in which the state is prepared repeatedly and measured in different bases.
  * [Quantum process tomography](process_tomography.ipynb) - using quantum process tomography to reconstruct the behaviour of a quantum process and measure its fidelity, i.e. how closely it matches the ideal version.
  * Randomized Benchmarking (Coming Soon)
