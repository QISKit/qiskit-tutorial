# Having fun with quantum computers
Here we have a few examples of quantum games. Enjoy!

  * [Battleships](reference/games/battleships_with_partial_NOT_gates.ipynb) - a version of Battleships made to run on `ibmqx2`. The unique properties of single qubit operations are used to implement the game mechanics, with the destruction of a ship corresponding to rotation from 0 to 1.
  * [Which is the counterfeit coin?](reference/games/quantum_counterfeit_coin_problem.ipynb) - can you solve the counterfeit coin riddle? Given a quantum computer and quantum beam balance, your task is to find a counterfeit coin hidden in a set of coins.
