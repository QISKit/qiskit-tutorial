# Working on approximate quantum computers

IBM Q Systems are approximate quantum computers, i.e., quantum computers with imperfect
gates and qubits that have limited operability. Fortunately, there are techniques that
can be applied to mitigate the limited operability of such near-term quantum computers.
Tutorials in this folder show how to use approximate quantum computers.
