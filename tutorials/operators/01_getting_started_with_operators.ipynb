    "1. State functions\n",
    "2. Operators and evolutions\n",
    "3. Measurements and expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes basic familiarty with qubits, quantum superposition and quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important underlying mathematical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An n-qubit State function is a complex function over n binary variables, which we will often refer to as n-qubit binary strings. For example, the traditional quantum “zero state” is a 1-qubit state function, with a definition of f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 0.\n",
    "* An n-qubit Operator is a linear function taking n-qubit state functions to n-qubit state functions. For example, the Pauli X Operator is defined by f(Zero) = One and f(One) = Zero. Equivalently, an Operator can be defined as a complex function over two n-qubit binary strings, and it is sometimes convenient to picture things this way. By this definition, our Pauli X can be defined by its typical matrix elements, f(0, 0) = 0, f(1, 0) = 1, f(0, 1) = 1, f(1, 1) = 0.\n",
    "* An n-qubit Measurement is a functional taking n-qubit State functions to complex values. For example, a Pauli Z Measurement can be defined by f(Zero) = 0 and f(One) = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions of these concepts mostly follows the ones in the first two chapters of the book [\"The Theory of Quantum Information\" by John Watrous](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/TQI/), but don't worry if you don't get them at the first glance: This tutorial is all about getting intuition behind them and the structure of the operator flow layer."

    "## State functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a single qubit. As we know, a pure state of a qubit is, in general, described as a superposition of basis states $\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha \\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta \\vert 1 \\rangle$ with complex coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We can think of this superposition as some mathematical object which puts into correspondence the ket $\\vert 0\\rangle$ with $\\alpha$ and $\\vert 1\\rangle$ with $\\beta$. This is exactly what the state functions in Aqua are. For example the well known minus state $\\vert \\psi_{-}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\vert 0 \\rangle - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\vert 1\\rangle$ can be thought of as a function mapping the basis ket $\\vert 0\\rangle$ to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and the basis ket $\\vert 1\\rangle$ to $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Basis states themselves are particular cases of state sunctions, e.g. the basis state $\\vert 0\\rangle$ can be thought of as a function mapping the ket $\\vert 0\\rangle$ to the number $1$ and the ket $\\vert 1\\rangle$ to the number $0$.\n",

Instead of specifying 2-qubit amplitudes to create a state function, as we did for the Bell state, we can use the tensoring capability of state functions to create the uniform superposition state. Tensoring of state functions can be done with the `.tensor()` function (`Plus.tensor(Plus)`) or the `^` symbol (`Plus ^ Plus`). Tensoring can be used also to do tensor powers, i.e. the second operand of tensoring can be an integer instead of a state function  and this will mean the tensor power of the first operand. E.g. let us create a uniform superposition state for five qubits"
