    "Qiskit provides sophisticated functionality with operators: [The \"Operator Flow\" layer in Aqua](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/qiskit.aqua.operators.html). In this tutorial notebook we will get familiar with the main building blocks of the operator flow layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State functions\n",
    "2. Operators and evolutions\n",
    "3. Measurements and expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes basic familiarty with qubits, quantum superposition and quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important underlying mathematical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An n-qubit State function is a complex function over n binary variables, which we will often refer to as n-qubit binary strings. For example, the traditional quantum “zero state” is a 1-qubit state function, with a definition of f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 0.\n",
    "* An n-qubit Operator is a linear function taking n-qubit state functions to n-qubit state functions. For example, the Pauli X Operator is defined by f(Zero) = One and f(One) = Zero. Equivalently, an Operator can be defined as a complex function over two n-qubit binary strings, and it is sometimes convenient to picture things this way. By this definition, our Pauli X can be defined by its typical matrix elements, f(0, 0) = 0, f(1, 0) = 1, f(0, 1) = 1, f(1, 1) = 0.\n",
    "* An n-qubit Measurement is a functional taking n-qubit State functions to complex values. For example, a Pauli Z Measurement can be defined by f(Zero) = 0 and f(One) = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions of these concepts mostly follows the ones in the first two chapters of the book [\"The Theory of Quantum Information\" by John Watrous](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/TQI/), but don't worry if you don't get them at the first glance: This tutorial is all about getting intuition behind them and the structure of the operator flow layer."

    "\n",
    "Let us start with a single qubit. As we know, a pure state of a qubit is, in general, described as a superposition of basis states $\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha \\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta \\vert 1 \\rangle$ with complex coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We can think of this superposition as some mathematical object which puts into correspondence the ket $\\vert 0\\rangle$ with $\\alpha$ and $\\vert 1\\rangle$ with $\\beta$. This is exactly what the state functions in Aqua are. For example the well known minus state $\\vert \\psi_{-}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\vert 0 \\rangle - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\vert 1\\rangle$ can be thought of as a function mapping the basis ket $\\vert 0\\rangle$ to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and the basis ket $\\vert 1\\rangle$ to $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Basis states themselves are particular cases of state sunctions, e.g. the basis state $\\vert 0\\rangle$ can be thought of as a function mapping the ket $\\vert 0\\rangle$ to the number $1$ and the ket $\\vert 1\\rangle$ to the number $0$.\n",
