    "## Running QISKit Programs using IBM Data Science Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "This article shows you how to run [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx) (IBM QX) Jupyter notebooks using [IBM Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com/) (IBM DSX).\n",
    "\n",
    "### About IBM Data Science Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM DSX is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to activate their insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just starting with QISKit and looking for a webhosted Jupyter notebook environment, IBM DSX is an excellent option. It is fairly easy to get your quantum notebook running in the Jupyter notebook environment provided by IBM DSX. Moreover, it provides a platform where you can create your quantum notebooks, invite fellow researchers to collaborate or simply share your work within the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to signup for the [IBM DSX](https://datascience.ibm.com/). Tip: It is often convenient to just use an IBM ID for signing up. If you do not have one already, [create it first](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html).\n",
    "- You also need an account for [IBM QX](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx). You can optionally use the IBM ID here as well. This account is required so that you can connect to the API using an 'API TOKEN'. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download [DSX.ipynb](DSX.ipynb)\n",
    "2. Logon to the [IBM DSX](https://datascience.ibm.com/) with your IBMID.\n",
    "3. Create a new notebook from your downloaded [DSX.ipynb](DSX.ipynb)\n",
    "4. Get your IBM QX API token\n",
    "    - Logon to the [IBM QX](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx)\n",
    "    - Click on your username on the top right, and select *My Account*\n",
    "    - Copy the token displayed there\n",
    "5. Update the value *`QX_API_TOKEN`* in the code cell with this API token you just copied in previous step.\n",
    "6. Run the code cell to install QISKit in your DSX account and connect to the IBM QX. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Upload other tutorial notebooks into IBM DSX, copy the following *code cell* and paste it at the beginning of the *other* notebooks"
