# Say Hello to QISKIT!

QISKIT is an open source software development kit designed to create quantum computing programs and execute them on real quantum processors or online/local simulators.

Weâ€™d love to see what you can make with the SDK. Here are some ideas to get you started.

- **Flip a coin with quantum**. Put one single qubit in superposition, and then measure it's state! Voila, you have your first quantum coin!
- **Random number generator**. You can put multiple qubits in superposition and then measure their state to get a perfect random number!
- **Spooky entangled states**. Entangle two qubits and then sit back and watch their spooky action at a distance!

If you would like your own recipe included in our featured hello world recipes, please send us a Pull Request with a link to your repository and a demo video.
