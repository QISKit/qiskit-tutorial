    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of the simple example of an algorithm for `Qiskit Aqua`. This samaple, called `Evolution Fidelity`, illustrates how to implement an algorithm and what steps to take to configure and run it. The implementation of the algorithm itself is located in the `evolutionfidelity` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you complete the algorithm implementation, you can refer to this [instruction](https://qiskit.org/documentation/aqua/extending.html#extending-aqua) to prepare the `setup.py` file to install the pluggable algorithm/component, which will be discovered in Aqua/Aqua-chemistry UI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we prepare a template `setup.py` file for this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, you will be able to use the developed algorithm directly in Python without any issue."
