# Operating Quantum Circuits with Qiskit Terra

This folder hosts notebooks on the basics of Quantum Circuits with Qiskit Terra.
Running quantum computation with Qiskit Terra starts with building quantum circuits, which
consist of quantum registers, classical registers, and quantum operations.
The circuits can then be run on various backends supported by Qiskit Terra.

* [Quantum Circuits](quantum_circuits.ipynb): teaches how to build quantum circuits that consist of quantum and classical registers and quantum gates and operators.

* [Quantum Operations](summary_of_quantum_operations.ipynb): lists all quantum operations one can do in quantum circuits.

* [Visualizating Circuits](visualizing_a_quantum_circuit.ipynb): shows different ways of visualizing quantum circuits.

* [Running Circuits and Monitoring](backend_monitoring_tools.ipynb): explains how to run quantum circuits on different backends and how to monitor their statuses.

* [Parallelization](terra_parallel_tools.ipynb): shows advanced methods to parallelize executions of functions. Helpful if one wants to work on many quantum circuits in parallel.
