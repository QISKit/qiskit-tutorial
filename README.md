Welcome to the Quantum Information Science Kit ([Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for short) tutorials!

In this repository, we've put together a collection of Jupyter notebooks aimed at teaching people who want to use the Qiskit for writing quantum computing programs and executing them on one of several backends (online quantum processors, online simulators, and local simulators). The online quantum processors connects to the [IBM Q](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/devices) devices.

## Installation and Setup
Please refer to this [installation guide](INSTALL.md) for installing and setting up Qiskit and tutorials on your own machine.

***

## Contents
We have organized the tutorials into two sections:

### 1. [Qiskit notebooks](qiskit/)<a id='qiskit'></a>
We've collected a core reference set of notebooks in this section outlining the features of Qiskit. We will be keeping them up to date with the latest Qiskit version, currently 0.6.  

### 2. [Community notebooks](community/)<a id='community'></a>
Teaching quantum and qiskit has so many different paths of learning. We love our community and we love the contributions so keep them coming. Because Qiskit is changing so much we cant keep this updated but there are some great notebooks in here. See 
- [Hello, Quantum World](community/hello_world/) learn form the community how to write your first quantum program.
- [Quantum games](community/hello_world/), learn quantum computing by having fun.
- [Quantum algorithms](community/algorithms/), learn Qiskit from the textbook algorithms. 
- [Teach Me Qiskit 2018](community/teach_me_qiskit_2018/), learn from the great contributions to the Teach Me Qiskit.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the tutorials, there are a number of ways to get involved:

* **Issues**: Issues can be reported with GitHub [issue reporting](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/issues) for this repository. Select `New issue`, fill in a descriptive title, and provide as much detail as is needed for the issue to be reproduced.
* **Notebooks**: If you would like to contribute a notebook, please create a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the repository from the `master` branch and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for your change. Note that new notebooks should be placed in the relevant part of the [Community](community/) section.
