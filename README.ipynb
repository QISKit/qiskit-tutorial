    "# QISKit Tutorials\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Quantum Information Software Kit ([QISKit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for short) tutorials! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this repository, we've put together a collection of Jupyter notebooks aimed at teaching people who want to use the [QISKit SDK](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py) for writing quantum computing programs and executing them on one of several backends (online quantum processors, online simulators, and local simulators). For the online quantum processors, QISKit uses the [QISKit API](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-api-py) to connect to the [IBM Q Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "***\n",
    "We have organised the tutorials into three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. [Hello World](/hello_world)\n",
    "Since quantum computing is so new, we want to find the best *Hello Quantum World* program and welcome submissions here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. [Reference](/reference)<a id='reference'></a>\n",
    "We've collected a core reference set of notebooks in this section. These notebooks demonstrate how to use QISKit and explore quantum information science, acting as a reference guide for QISKit. We will be keep them up to date with [QISKit SDK](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py) updates. They are organized into the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 [Getting started with QISKit](/reference/tools)\n",
    "In this first topic, we introduce you to the basic features of QISKit. More tutorials covering QISKit features can be found in [here](#appendix_tools) and developer documentation can be found [here](https://www.qiskit.org/documentation/).\n",
    "  * Getting started\n",
    "  * Working with different backends\n",
    "  * Using different gates\n",
    "  * Visualisation of quantum states\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### 2.2 [Introduction to quantum information science](/reference/qis)\n",
    "The next set of notebooks shows how you can explore some simple concepts of quantum information science. More tutorials on other quantum information science concepts can be found [here](#appendix_qis)\n",
    "  * [Superposition and entanglement](/reference/qis/superposition_and_entanglement.ipynb) - this tutorial shows you how to make simple quantum states on one and two qubits, and demonstrates concepts such as quantum superpositions and entanglement.\n",
    "  * [Entanglement revisited](/reference/qis/entanglement_revisited.ipynb) - this tutorial delves deeper into quantum entanglement, looking at the CHSH inequality and Mermin's test.\n",
    "  * [Quantum teleportation and superdense coding](reference/qis/teleportation_superdensecoding.ipynb) - this tutorial introduces two simple quantum communication protocols, based on the quantum entanglement. \n",
    "    \n",
    "####  2.3 [Understanding your quantum computer](/reference/qcvv)\n",
    "  * Relaxation and decoherence\n",
    "  * Quantum tomography\n",
    "  * Random Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "####  2.4 [Working an approximate quantum quantum computers](/reference/approximate)\n",
    "  * Variational Quantum Eigensolver\n",
    "  * Small error correcting codes\n",
    "  * Error mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.5 [Examples of quantum algorithms](/reference/algorithms)\n",
    "  * [Deutschâ€“Jozsa algorithm](reference/algorithms/deustch_josza.ipynb) - a deterministic quantum algorithm that outperforms the corresponding classical algorithm.\n",
    "  * [Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm](reference/algorithms/bernstein_vazirani.ipynb) - a quantum algorithm that outperforms classical probabilistic algorithms.\n",
    "  * [Phase estimation](reference/algorithms/iterative_phase_estimation_algorithm.ipynb) - a quantum algorithm to extract eigenvalues of unknown unitary operator.\n",
    "  * Simon's algorithm\n",
    "  * Grover's algorithm\n",
    "  * Shor's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "####  2.6 [Having fun with quantum computers](/reference/games)\n",
    "  * Battleships\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. [Appendix](/appendix)<a id='appendix'></a>\n",
    "This is where the rest of the tutorials are. They are not guaranteed to work with the latest version of the QISKit SDK. They are organised into various topics:\n",
    "  1. Advanced QISKit features<a id='appendix_tools'></a>\n",
    "  2. More on quantum information science<a id='appendix_qis'></a>\n",
    "  3. Further quantum algorithms and applications<a id='appendix_algorithms'></a>\n",
    "  4. Everything else<a id='appendix_other'></a>\n",
    "\n",
